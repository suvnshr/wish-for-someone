# Wish for someone

Just playing around with what can be done with really simple ideas instead of the more "complex ones"

## Setup

- Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/suvnshr/wish-for-someone.git`

- Install node 20: `nvm install lts/iron`

- Use node 20: `nvm use 20`

- Install packages: `cd wish-for-someone; npm install`

- Run development server: `npm run dev`

- Access the development server at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Supabase setup

This project uses [Supabase's](https://supabase.com/) postgres db. To get a list of wishes in the home screen:

- [Setup a supabase project](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/nextjs)

- Add the required envs:

  ```.env
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
  ```

- [Create a table](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/tables#creating-tables) named `"wishes"` with the below given schema:

  ```SQL

  create table
      public.wishes (
          id bigint generated by default as identity,
          created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
          wish text null default ''::text,
          author text null default ''::text,
          likes bigint null default '0'::bigint,
          constraint wishes_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
  ```

- Add update and read [RLS](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) policies to your db to enable read and update to your db.

- That's it, you are ready to use the project!
